Instructions:

Inside the directory run command - mix run proj_1.exs arg_1 arg_2 (N = arg_1, k = arg_2)

Output - Every series starting point that satisfies the project requirements will be printed on a seperate line.

Project metrics:

Work unit size - 2500. We tried different batch sizes and found 2500 to give us the maximum ratio between CPU time and real time.


Result of running mix run proj_1.exs 1000000 4 - There was no output as no there is no sequence which satisfies the given input.


Running time of above input - 37 ms. Ratio of CPU time to real time - 2.5


Largest problem solved - N - 500000000 K - 75000 (Runtime - 11 min 20 sec 16 ms, Ratio - 3.94)
